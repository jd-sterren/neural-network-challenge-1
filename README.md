**1. Describe the data that you would need to collect to build a recommendation system to recommend student loan options for students. Explain why this data would be relevant and appropriate.**

**Aside from the previously used columns within the dataset, it would be pertinent to use the student's income information, credit score, and debt-to-income ratio.  Given that a student right out of high school may not have much of either, if they are dependent or independent would also be needed.**

**2. Based on the data you chose to use in this recommendation system, would your model be using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or context-based filtering? Justify why the data you selected would be suitable for your choice of filtering method.**

**My model would be using context-based filtering since there may be unique situations for student loans such as non-traditional student in their 40s but will take the limited data of fresh into the world students into consideration.**

**3. Describe two real-world challenges that you would take into consideration while building a recommendation system for student loans. Explain why these challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system.**

**One significant challenge is ensuring fairness and equity in the recommendations. Relying solely on income-based data and credit scores may lead to biased outcomes, particularly for individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Another critical challenge is maintaining data privacy and security. Gathering information for credit score assessment and financial background checks raises concerns about data security, including the storage and deletion of data in compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations.**
